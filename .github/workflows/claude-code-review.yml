          prompt: |
            You are a CI gating agent. Run a sub-agent with this exact prompt:

            Run `/code-review:code-review ${{ github.repository }}/pull/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}`.

            After completing the review and posting your findings to the pull request, output
            exactly one of the following as the very last line of your response — no other text
            after it:

            VERDICT:pass
            VERDICT:fail

            Use `VERDICT:pass` only if you found zero blocking issues. Use `VERDICT:fail` for
            any blocking issues, or if you were unable to complete the review.

            Once the sub-agent finishes, scan its response for lines matching exactly `VERDICT:pass`
            or `VERDICT:fail`. If multiple such lines are present, use the last one. If no such line
            is present, treat it as `VERDICT:fail` (fail-closed).

            Call the `structured_output` tool with:
            {
              "verdict": "<pass or fail>",
              "summary": "<complete sub-agent response text, excluding the final VERDICT line>"
            }

      - name: Gate on missing verdict
        # Fail-closed: if Claude succeeded but emitted no structured output, something went wrong
        if: steps.claude-review.outcome == 'success' && steps.claude-review.outputs.structured_output == ''
        run: |
          echo "Claude succeeded but emitted no structured verdict. Failing closed."
          exit 1

      - name: Gate on review verdict
        # Fail-closed: fail if Claude ran successfully and returned verdict != pass
        if: steps.claude-review.outcome == 'success' && steps.claude-review.outputs.structured_output != '' && fromJSON(steps.claude-review.outputs.structured_output).verdict != 'pass'
        run: |
          echo "Claude found blocking issues. See PR review for details."
          exit 1

      - name: Check review completed
        if: failure() && steps.claude-review.outcome == 'failure'
        run: echo "Claude Code Review action failed to complete. Check logs for details."
