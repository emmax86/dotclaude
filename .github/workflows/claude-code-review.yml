            After completing the review, write a verdict to GitHub Actions output based on the severity of findings:
            - Treat as **blocking issues** any problems that should prevent merging the PR until fixed. Examples include:
              - Functional bugs or logic errors
              - Security vulnerabilities or unsafe patterns
              - Critical performance regressions (e.g., potential timeouts, OOM risks)
              - Breaking changes to public APIs or contracts
              - Changes that cause tests to fail or likely introduce instability
              If any such blocking issues are present, run: `echo "verdict=fail" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`
            - Treat as **minor suggestions** any findings that are nice-to-have but not merge-blocking. Examples include:
              - Style or formatting nits
              - Documentation or comment improvements
              - Optional refactoring ideas that do not address bugs
              - Non-critical performance or readability improvements
              If there are only minor suggestions or no issues, run: `echo "verdict=pass" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT`
